# R-TypeEpitech
My R-Type project of Epitech. This project allow me to understand how to make a network game.

Compile the project:

chmod +x install_linux.sh
./install_linux.sh
cd bin

Normally you have the client executable and the server executable.

PS: If you want to connect to multiple people and on different computers to the same server, you must be connected to the same network
